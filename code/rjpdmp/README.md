# Reversible Jump PDMP methods R package

rjpdmp is an R package that provides an implementation of the reversible jump PDMP methods developed in the paper Reversible Jump PDMP Samplers for Variable Selection (Chevallier, Fearnhead, Sutton 2020, https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11771). It also contains an implementation of a Gibbs sampler for variable selection in Logistic regression based on Polya-Gamma augmentation (code for simulating PG variables adapted from https://github.com/jgscott/helloPG).
