## Data sets generated for simulation studies

The datasets in this directory may be generated using the appropriate R script located in the `code` directory. The datasets and corresponding scripts are outlined below:

1. The 60 datasets investigated in the logistic regression tables (for $n=100,200,400,800$, $p=100,200,400$ and 5 simulation settings). Script `code\generate_logit_data.R`

2. The Logistic regression subsampling example. Script `code\generate_logit_subsample_data.R`

3. The Robust Regression example. Script `code\generate_robust_data.R`

The data is simulated according to the wording of Section 5 in the manuscript.
